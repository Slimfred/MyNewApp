# README

This README is for an app that I will be writing for my CareerFoundry Class.
This was written using Ruby version 2.3 and Rails version 5.


Task 4.1 - For this task I created scaffolding for products in my app.  I then added three products to my database.  Next I reformatted the products page to show product pictures and fit the style of the other pages in the app.  During this process I decided to create a simple logo out of the app name and updated all other pages using the new logo.  All changes have been pushed to Github and Heroku.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Database initialization

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
